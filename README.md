# weighted-birkhoff-parameterization
MatLab scripts for the paper Weighted Birkhoff Averages and the Parameterization Method

In the henon folder the script file to run the program is "newtonScript.m" and for numerical continuation "numericalContinuationScript.m".

In the standard folder the script file to run the program is "newtonMethodScript.m" and for numerical continuation "numericalContinuation.m". I will mention the standard map contiuation is very unstable.
